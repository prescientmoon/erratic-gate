# Logic-gate-simulator

This was my first attempt at making a logic gate simulator. I did this right after finishing the 8th grade, and let's just say it wasn't so good:) If you want to check out an actually good logic gate simulator, check out [my latest attempt at doing it](https://github.com/Mateiadrielrafael/logicGateSimulator)

Basic controls:
  Tap on the blue box to add components
  Tap on 2 pins to connect them
  Tap on a cable to remove it
  Enjoy XD
  
  Contributions are welcome (if for some reason you want to contribute to this).
